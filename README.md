# Customer-Segmentation-Using-Clustering
 Customer segmentation model for a bank’s credit card holders. The goal is to segment customers based on their transaction and credit usage patterns,  allowing the bank to tailor marketing strategies for each segment more effectively.

1. Data Preprocessing:
 ○ Handle missing values.
 ○ Apply feature scaling and any necessary feature engineering.
 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
 ○ Conduct thorough EDA, including data visualizations and key insights.
 3. Clustering:
 ○ Apply at least two clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN).
 ○ Evaluate the quality of clusters using relevant metrics (e.g., silhouette score).
 ○ Determine the optimal number of clusters.
 4. Cluster Profiling:
 ○ Provide detailed descriptions of each segment.
 ○ Propose marketing strategies for each segment.
 5. Deliverables:
 ○ AJupyter Notebook or Python script with:
 ■ Datapreprocessing steps
 ■ EDA
 ■ Clustering analysis
 ■ Cluster profiling and marketing recommendations
 ○ A5-minute video explaining your approach, reasoning, and key findings.
 6. Optional (Bonus):
 ○ Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or other dimensionality reduction
 techniques before clustering and assess its impact
